## List Of Shame

A non-exhaustive list of dank projects.

* [#saveminecraft](https://youtu.be/wXQoH4IQGMM)
* 1.8 - Has more exploits and security issues than [days it is old](https://howoldisminecraft188.today/).
* 1.7 - Like 1.8 but worse and [even older](https://howoldisminecraft1710.today/).
* Every closed-source, paid (1.8) Paper fork - "\[Optimized\] \[Cannons\] \[Everything is
  multithreaded\]." **If this list can give one piece of serious advice: Do not waste your money on them.**
* [NFTWorlds](https://www.nftworlds.com) - Selling [Minecraft seeds and skins](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-worlds)
  on the blockchain
  and [getting mad at Mojang](https://routing.nftworlds.com/ipfs/QmXRLKdmEReiTWoESHFfUUrJoWkUX2obye3urL6x8zt5Bx) for
  [disallowing their wonderful practices](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-and-nfts).
* [StellarDev](https://stellardev.org/), Aside from the usual closed-source Spigot
  forks, get paid to steal code without
  attribution, [bar a little slip up...](https://github.com/NFT-Worlds/Server/blob/4f7bc3329aadac0667b8bb8d6d384558566af6ff/patches/server/0046-Async-Entities.patch#L238)<!-- Even more ironic if you look at who this was made for -->
* [Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia), [Mirai](https://github.com/etil2jz/Mirai) - *[Ouch](https://github.com/kennytv/Yaptapia)*.
* Hybrid Servers (Forge/Something else + Bukkit) - Servers that combine
  two incompatible APIs and break them both in the process.
    * [MagmaMC](https://github.com/MagmaFoundation/Magma) - Brake EssentialsX Code([See The Warning](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html)) and also [Abused log4j bug](https://pixelmonmod.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=29799&p=210147)
    * [CatServer](https://github.com/Luohuayu/CatServer) - [Breaking license restrictions](https://github.com/Luohuayu/FoxServer/issues/7#issuecomment-1100009357).
     * [NogyangForge](https://github.com/GAME-CLI-SRV-DEV/NogyangForge) - added Geyser-Neoforge 2.3.0 Support + Floodgate-Core 2.2.3 and Ultimately Modified Bukkit API to Support Mods Properly. but still, it count as Same Reason with purpur. 
* [PolyMC](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC) - Common sense and decency? [Never heard of her](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee).
* [Songoda](https://songoda.com/marketplace) - We still tell tales of one of the most sketchy plugin marketplaces.
* [Yooniks](https://www.mc-market.org/members/126711/) - If you feel like you have too much money and you are looking
  for closed-source forks of Bungee/Spigot, look no further.
* [Kangarko](https://github.com/kangarko) - Advertising genius behind paid plugin-courses.
    - Latest victim of his blame: [All of SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/478408/)
* [EpicWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicworldgenerator.8067/) - Because it sure is worth spending
  $20 for something that has several free alternatives with the same features.
    * Also [based on code directly stolen from a free mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/km185p/epic_world_generator_is_based_almost_entirely_on/) ([Realistic World Gen](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3))
* [WorldQL](https://www.worldql.com/posts/2021-08-worldql-scalable-minecraft/) - A prime example of the power of
  advertising, vastly blown out of proportion despite countless üö©.
* [EntityTrackerFixer](https://github.com/Esmorall/EntityTrackerFixer) - Minecraft tracks alot of entities - so let's
  just not do that.
* [PM2](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/pm2.597961/) - 10/10 review and resource bumping (not to be confused
  with [pm2 Process Manager](https://pm2.io/)).
* [SunLight](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sunlight.67733/) - Taking RGB chat formatting to another level, parsing hex codes in
  *other plugins'* commands with the only way around that being
  to [use their library to convert them back](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/sunlight.374716/page-39#post-4124177). (bro just use MiniMessage)
* [ProVotes](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/provotes.23672/) - Premium in
  the [least premium way possible](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/issues/77).
* [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) - What if someone made a fork instead of just creating plugins doing the same things?
* [NogyangSpigot](https://github.com/GAME-CLI-SRV-DEV/NogyangSpigot) - Same Reason With Purpur.
* [ClearLagg](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clearlagg.68271/) - Causes more lag than it removes and doesn't even know its own name.
* [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji) - Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of
  identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used... as long as you can learn
  the intended, sometimes overlapping use of 80 only vaguely cohesive emojis by heart (guess what üç± means).
* [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit.13932) - Fast, fast at breaking things.
* [AsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/asyncworldedit-premium.9661/) - Like FAWE, but slower and breaking the WorldEdit license.
* [CMI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi.3742/) - A substitute for EssentialsX for the people that think paid=good. Also the only plugin in existence that had a ping command that
  * parses placeholders in the optional player argument
  * has a placeholder to send messages to the console
  * makes that console display possible by having the console execute the argument in a command
* [SkinsRestorer](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX) - `System.out.println("[SkinsRestorer] ")`, `try {} catch (Exception e) {}`".
* [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion) - Continuously allows evil to exist.
* [ProtocolSupport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocolsupport.7201/) - Like ViaBackwards, just with even
  more evil.
* [Retrooper](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/issues/46)
* [Retrooper, again](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/pull/67)
* [The Duper Trooper](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Nuc3040H1WjeO9aoY4NPg) - Clickbait YouTube channel that "leaks"
  often outdated exploits and encourages bad habits around security issues.
* [kennytv](https://www.twitch.tv/kennytvn) - German streamer who has repeatedly failed to meet streaming obligations, and works on [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion), which Continuously Allows "Evil" to Exist.
* [alexisl315](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/190298/) - Your go-to dev for so bad it's funny Skript recreations of
  popular plugins.

## Software Alternatives / Info Threads

This section is the only part of this page you should *actually* take somewhat seriously.

* "Super optimized all-in-one server" alternatives: The most performant AND properly stable will likely always be Paper.
    * Info: <https://github.com/kennytv/Yaptapia> (not necessarily bound to Yatopia)
* "Hybrid" (Forge/something else + Bukkit) server
  info/alternatives: Info: [Essentials' PSA](https://essentialsx.net/do-not-use-mohist.html), [Essentials' Downloads](https://essentialsx.net/downloads), Alternative: [SpongeForge](https://www.Spongepowered.org).
* Anti-lag plugin alternative setup and info: <https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/283181/>
  and <https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/283181/page-20#post-3684550>
* Dupe fixer alternative: Simply use Paper (not one of the cursed forks as mentioned above) and stay on the latest version of Minecraft
 ... unless you run a creative server, then plugins make sense to clear data-spammed items.
* EWG
  info/alternatives: <https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/km185p/epic_world_generator_is_based_almost_entirely_on/>
* SkinsRestorer alternative: *For the love of god, **don't use offline mode***.
* CMI alternative: EssentialsX, given its free, open source, and you are less likely to run into problems, or will have
  them fixed faster... though there isn't really anything wrong with liking CMI how it is, either.
